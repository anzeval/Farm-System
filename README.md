# Farm-System
Grid-based farming system with a data-driven architecture. The world is represented as a cell grid with entities (grass, rocks, trees) separated from visual logic. Tools interact via polymorphism, loot and inventory use events, and systems are decoupled for scalability and clean Unity lifecycle handling.
